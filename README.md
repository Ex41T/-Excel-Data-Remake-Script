<h1>WordPress Report Processing Script</h1>


<h3>Purpose:</h3>

<h5>This script is designed to process .xls reports generated by a specific WordPress-based system. To work correctly, the input file structure must align precisely with the expected format. Using files with a different structure will likely result in errors.</h5>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<h5>This script streamlines the handling of customer order data exported from a WordPress system. In its raw form, the report often repeats customer information for every product in an order. For example, if a customer orders three products, their details appear on three separate rows. The script eliminates these redundancies, organizing the data into a more structured and actionable format for analysis and logistics.</h5>

<h1>Key Features</h1>

<h3>Duplicate Customer Data:</h3>

<h5>Combines repetitive customer information into a single, consolidated entry.</h5>

<h3>Data Cleaning:</h3>

<h5>Strips unnecessary HTML tags (e.g., <b>, <i>) from product names, ensuring they are clean and readable.</h5>

<h3>Product Bundles:</h3>

<h5>Automatically dissects product bundles (e.g., "Pakiet Klasyczny") into their individual components, listing each item with its respective quantity.</h5>

<h3>Weight Calculation:</h3>

<h5>Converts product quantities into total weights in kilograms. For example, products like "150g," "500g," and "1kg" are aggregated to provide a total weight.

<h3>Logistics Reports:</h3>

<h5>Generates a delivery report tailored for courier services by filtering out unnecessary data and including only relevant customer and order details.</h5>

<h3>Excel Formatting:</h3>

  <h4>Adjusts column widths automatically for better readability.
  Highlights important rows (e.g., containing "w kawa≈Çku").
  Organizes the processed data into three distinct Excel sheets for clarity.
