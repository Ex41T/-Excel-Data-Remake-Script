<h1>WordPress Report Processing Script</h1>


<h3>Purpose:</h3>

<h5>This script is designed to process .xls reports generated by a specific WordPress-based system. To work correctly, the input file structure must align precisely with the expected format. Using files with a different structure will likely result in errors.</h5>

<h3>Overview</h3>

This script streamlines the handling of customer order data exported from a WordPress system. In its raw form, the report often repeats customer information for every product in an order. For example, if a customer orders three products, their details appear on three separate rows. The script eliminates these redundancies, organizing the data into a more structured and actionable format for analysis and logistics.

Key Features

Duplicate Customer Data:

  Combines repetitive customer information into a single, consolidated entry.

Data Cleaning:

  Strips unnecessary HTML tags (e.g., <b>, <i>) from product names, ensuring they are clean and readable.

Product Bundles:

  Automatically dissects product bundles (e.g., "Pakiet Klasyczny") into their individual components, listing each item with its respective quantity.

Weight Calculation:

  Converts product quantities into total weights in kilograms. For example, products like "150g," "500g," and "1kg" are aggregated to provide a total weight.

Logistics Reports:

  Generates a delivery report tailored for courier services by filtering out unnecessary data and including only relevant customer and order details.

Excel Formatting:

  Adjusts column widths automatically for better readability.
  Highlights important rows (e.g., containing "w kawa≈Çku").
  Organizes the processed data into three distinct Excel sheets for clarity.
